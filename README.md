# RESTful API for a Store.

Here in this repository, you will find a flask RESTful API for a store.

Before getting started with the project, you need to setup a virtual environment and install all the dependencies. For installing the dependencies follow the instruction as mentioned below. Alternatively, you can use other python environment. Here I've used `virtualenv`.
Note:  All the requirements for this entire project is listed in `requirements.txt`. 

To install `virtualenv` in Linux: `sudo apt install virtualenv`

1. First, install python virtual environment: `virtualenv -p python3 <environment-name>`
2. Activate the virtual environment as: `soucrce path-to-environment/bin/activate`
3. Install all the dependencies as: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Create a `.env` file with variables list as in `.env-example` file.
5. Now, to run the app, simply enter the command: `python3 app.py`
